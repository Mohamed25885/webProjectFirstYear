                Language has been our primary mean of communication and human interaction for thousands of years. For a
                community, the language contained the words that the people need to communicate, words themselves are
                abstract, but they indicate the meaning, they point to objects or actions, etc..
                <br><br>
                When you look at your computer, you’ll find it’s not so much different. There are many pieces of
                hardware
                and software that need to communicate with each other. Your application is reacting to the mouse and
                keyboard or even the mic, it can read files from your disk storage and so on. But at the end of the day,
                the
                machine understands nothing but bits, 1s, and 0s, the combination of which creates meaning.
                <br><br>
                The very earliest computers were actually programmed by changing ones and zeros manually, alternating
                the
                circuit and the wiring. Of course, it was not easy to create many programs as most were used for
                specific
                applications only, and they were gigantic in size so they were quite limited. That’s why the creation of
                programming languages was a revolutionary step that took the field to another level. Unlike normal
                languages, keywords in programming languages are limited, and by combining these keywords, developers
                are
                able to create different types of programs. There are special pieces of software that turn the code you
                write into machine language that the machine understands. So what is programming language? In short, a
                programming language is the set of instructions through which humans interact with computers.

            <h2>
                What is a Programming Language? What is Code?
            </h2>
            <p class="paragraph">
                The code is pretty much like writing a paragraph of instruction or creating a to-do list to computers.
                Unlike us humans, the to-do list and instructions you write for the computer has to be extremely
                detailed and written in some logic.
                <br><br>
                With code and programming, you can get the computer to draw complex shapes and create rich computer
                graphics, and then create programs that understand game mechanics and help you build games that feel
                real with gravity and particle collision, with these programs you can create the most intense and
                immersive games of all sorts.
                <br><br>
                With code and programming, you can create and send content all over the world with your blog and
                personal website and style your blog to meet your style. You can build tech-driven business solutions
                and reach a wider range of customer and cater to a wider range of needs.
                <br><br>
                Furthermore, with code and programming, you can create smart home applications, like an automated pet
                feeder, a smart mirror or even create a robot that can help around with household tasks and be your
                virtual assistant to talk to and understand you. Unlike what many people think, there’s a lot of art
                involved in computer engineering and computer science.
